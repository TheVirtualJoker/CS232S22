midpoint A failed when testing Min integer and Max integer. This is due to an issue with negative numbers, so its midpoint can only be calculated when there is positive integers. X+Y with min integer and max integer equals -1. /2 would still be negative -1 or 0 since we have to round. than it adds x back to the number which than will add min integer again causing it to show the wrong answer. however, if the min number is greater than 0, it will display the correct number. Midpoint B also the same issue however the number is positive instead of negative since it may add the max integer back into itself. C displays the correct number a slight increase in min causes it to display the wrong midpoint.
